# Fighter-Game
Write here the description...This project is a Java-based interactive game simulation where two players, "Player1" and "Player2" engage in combat using different weapons. The game allows actions such as shooting with two types of guns, healing, and quitting. "Player2" has an additional feature, armor, which reduces damage taken. The game continuously tracks health and announces the winner when one player's health reaches zero.
